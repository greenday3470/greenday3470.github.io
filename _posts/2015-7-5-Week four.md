Quit a busy week, had our first test and the professor introduced our first group project. Honestly I'm pretty lost about what I should play a part at first. Gladly our group leader was really proactive and I really respect him for it. 

The project consists of five people, and we are going to build an interactive website and have a free server that can host it. The project is a three phrase work, which I still don't quite understand how the next two are about. But seemly it's progress based project. It's kind of hard to work with the group at first I guess it's because it's a holiday weekend and some people are out of town. But we all agreed to pick some parts of the project and execute them on our parts. 

For my part, I was really interested into the the step that requires us to make a static html page, so I took that part myself. Reason being I have never learned about css or html that makes a webpage looks nice. It's kind of interesting that once you learned a programming language the others come naturally, because the concepts are the same or similar just the syntax and the functionalities are different from the applications. So far the learning of html it's beena crash course, and there are sill a lot of things I'm not so sure especially css, supposedly to make the actual webpage looks nice. But I'm learning as I encounter challenges. I guess this is how the real gourp to solve the problem, figure out how to solve the problem by finding resources on your own. This week's entry is kind of short, but I really enjoyed the projects so far, they are hard but fair. 

Tip of the week: use codeacademy is a good way for daily practice of learning some language, I used codeacademy to learn basic html and css and it has helped me tremendously!
