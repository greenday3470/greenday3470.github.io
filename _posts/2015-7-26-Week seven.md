title: Week 7
---


last week of this class, it feels like the time went by too fast, I guess it's because we've been working on our project for a consecutive three weeks that just drained our body and soul. This week was pretty chill, kind of sad professor Downing couldn't be with us this whole week to check out our presentations, but hey, free credits for quizzes you cannot really complain about it right?

Anyway, this week is a week of presentations from all the groups from the class and a prepartion for our last exam on next Monday, that is tomorrow because I'm writing this entry on Sunday haha. Our group was the 2nd to present our website. I think it's a good order, we've been practicing how to impress our audience with our creative methods. I think it is important to make a presentaiton attractive but also display the key points of our product, because later in our career I am pretty sure we will have to present our end-product to our clients or even our supervisor for approval. So learning to speak in front of people it is a essential skill for everyone including CS student. 

We made our presentation "function" like, organized each points with legitimate python syntax and we added some easter eggs within to surprise our professor that we love him and his teaching. One cool thing was that we actually played some music during the presentation and since our site is about music it was appropriate in our opinion to demonstrate to our class that you can listen those music on our site. 

After our presentations, many other groups presented well, I was amazed by other groups' ideas and implementation of different feature, for example, a few groups had made their site with a video background to capture visitors' eyes, and that is the very one we wanted to implement in our site since day 1, by listening to their explanation of various designs I really wish I can modify our website to make it more sophisticated. I guess that is the beauty of software engineering in that sense that you can keep develop on what you already built to perfect it according to what customers desired or depends on what feature of the product you want to ellaborate on. I believe it is crucial to acquire that mind set and this class has given this mind set, there are many tools we can utilize and it is important we learn them as we use them, which is likely the case for our projects. Many of us had little or no experience of our tasks and our tool but by the team effort we were able to construct a webiste from ground zero which was an awesome experience.

Tip of the week:  http://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/python3/ learn X in Y minutes has been a blessing for me to nail down some basic syntax almost most of the languages we are required to use in classes. I recommend every CS student to check it out!
