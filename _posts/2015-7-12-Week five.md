Another busy week of 373, we had to finish our one of three-phase project by Tuesday and started to learn more syntax on Java Script and also some introductions of SQL. I never played nor knew about SQL at all but the demonstration by Dr. Downing showed the usefulness of that language as we learn to utilize it to manipulate data. We learned cross join, theata join and a join funciton called natural join. Cool thing about these functions was we implemented these SQL functions by Python and that was pretty cool, though I didn't figure out some of the implementation at first, but the solutions professor posted made a lot of sense to me.

About our group project, we decided to take music database as our choice. This week we will work more on data based to apply our cache and somehow put the data to our server and sort them out. Basically it's a website that includes artists and albums, as you browse around the pictures, which I recommended my teammates to use black and white to show the beauty of style, it will take the user to an individual page of the artist or album. so far I had to manually create those pages, and my task is to make sure they look great from outside by using css and html syntax. I'm excited to see the second phase as our team works together to make this site happens. 

There might be more questions or challenges we have to figure them out by ourselves, but that I really enjoyed to search for answers during the progress. I've learned a lot from my teammates by working as a team, whenever you're struggled they are there to help and assist you.
